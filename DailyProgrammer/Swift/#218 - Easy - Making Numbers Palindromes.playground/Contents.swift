/* To covert nearly any number into a palindromic number you operate by reversing the digits and adding and then repeating the steps until you get a palindromic number. Some require many steps.

e.g. 24 gets palindromic after 1 steps: 66 -> 24 + 42 = 66

while 28 gets palindromic after 2 steps: 121 -> 28 + 82 = 110, so 110 + 11 (110 reversed) = 121.

Note that, as an example, 196 never gets palindromic (at least according to researchers, at least never in reasonable time). Several numbers never appear to approach being palindromic. */
